About
-------------

PAX provides easy interacting between PHP and AJAX while it reduces at the same time written code in Javascript and improves the way of managing and manipulating DOM elements from the backend in an object oriented style.

Although PAX was inspired by the awesome xajax-project it is using a slightly different approach. PAX is a way more simple but still flexible while it makes use of abstractions and object extensions. With that approach it doesn't offer a plugin technology but makes it fairly easy to give you the power of creating your own Responder. That furthermore lowers the number of code and makes sure you include only code you really need.

License
-------------

PAX is released under "The MIT License" and is free and open source. Please feel free to download, modify and extend the code.

Requirements
-------------

Although PAX was developed with below requirements it's fairly easy to amend the code to meet the requirements of your development environment.

* PHP 5.4+
* jQuery 1.7+
* AJAX enabled browser

Enjoy!
